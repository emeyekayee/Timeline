Timeline is a schedule widget, initially built for Rails, that uses
Javascript, prototype.js and AJAX to show how resources are used over time.
The basic building-block is a DOM block (a resource row) containing a label
and a timespan:

                +-------+----------------------+
                | label |       timespan       |
                |       | block | ... | block  |
                +-------+----------------------+

The timespan contains of a set of blocks, each describing the use of that
resource over an interval in that timespan.

If the resource is "Channel 3" you have one row of a tv schedule; each block
is a program.  (See the example Rails app in example/tv.)  Resource rows stack
atop one-another and the timespans scroll left or right.  All the timespans in
a schedule scroll in lock-step.

Time is represented in the usual seconds-since-Jan-1-1970-GMT.  The only thing
time-specific about this as the X-axis is that it maps to an continuous
integer range.

The representation is flexible.  For example, headers showing time-of-day (See
the example app.) are just another kind of resource -- one whose label is
simply the text "Hour" and whose blocks are time segments with text: "9:30",
"9:45"...  Same applies for the date header.

Time blocks of all resources are clipped to the visible part of the schedule.
So you can also create, in effect, non-scrolling toolbars or headers just by
making a resource with a single time block having very small/large
starttime/endtime.
