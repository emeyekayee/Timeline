Timeline is a schedule widget, initially built for Rails, that uses
Javascript, prototype.js and AJAX to show how resources are used over time.
The basic building-block is a DOM block (a resource row) containing a label
and a timespan:

                +-------+----------------------+
                | label |       timespan       |
                |       | block | ... | block  |
                +-------+----------------------+

The timespan contains a set of blocks, each describing the use of that
resource over an interval in that timespan.  If the resource is "Channel 3"
and each block is a "tv program" you have one row of a tv schedule.  See the
example Rails app in example/tv.

Resource rows stack atop one-another and the timespans scroll left or right.
All the timespans in a schedule scroll in lock-step.  New blocks are fetched
from the server as needed, AJAX-style.

Time is represented in the usual seconds-since-Jan-1-1970-GMT.  The only thing
time-specific about this as the X-axis is that it maps to an continuous
integer range.

The representation is flexible.  For example, headers showing time-of-day (See
the example app.) are just another kind of resource -- one whose label is
simply the text "Hour" and whose blocks are time segments with text: "9:30",
"9:45"...  Same applies for the date header.

Time blocks of all resources are clipped to the visible part of the schedule.
So you can also create toolbars or headers that appear not to scroll with
time.  Just make a resource with a single time block that has very small/large
start/endtimes.
