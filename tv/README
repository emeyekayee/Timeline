Timeline is a schedule widget, built on Rails, that uses Javascript,
jQuery and AJAX to show how resources are used over time.  The basic
building-block is a DOM block (a resource row) containing a label and
a timespan:

                +-------+----------------------+
                | label |       timespan       |
                |       | block | ... | block  |
                +-------+----------------------+

The timespan contains a set of blocks, each describing the use of that
resource over an interval of that timespan.  If the resource is "Channel 3"
and each block is a "tv program" you have one row of a tv schedule.  See the
example Rails app in tv/.

Resource rows stack atop one-another.  All the timespans in a schedule
scroll left and right in lock-step.  New blocks are fetched from the
server as needed, AJAX-style.

Time is represented in the usual seconds-since-Jan-1-1970-GMT, though
the only thing time-specific about this as the X-axis is that it maps
to a continuous range.

The model classes SchedResource and ResourceUseBlock maintain the
mappings between the abstract schedule resources and resource uses, and
the concrete model classes they represent.

The representation is flexible.  For example, headers showing time-of-day (See
the example app.) are just another kind of resource -- one whose label is
simply the text "Hour" and whose blocks are time segments with text: "9:30",
"9:45"...  Same applies for the date header.

Time blocks of all resources are clipped to the visible part of the schedule,
so you can also create toolbars or headers that *appear* not to scroll with
time.  Just make a resource with a single time block that has very small/large
start/endtimes.
